## File Structure

```
language-translator-ui/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main HTML structure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css          # CSS styling and responsive design

## Technical Implementation

### Translation Database
The application uses a nested JavaScript object structure to store translations:
```javascript
translationDatabase = {
    [sourceLang]: {
        [targetLang]: {
            [sourceText]: translatedText
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Features Implementation
- **Real-time Translation**: Event listeners on input and language selection
- **Voice Recognition**: Uses Web Speech API for voice input
- **Text-to-Speech**: Uses Speech Synthesis API for voice output
- **Responsive Design**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for mobile compatibility

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- Speech Recognition: Chrome, Edge (requires HTTPS in production)
- Text-to-Speech: Most modern browsers

## Sample Translations

The application comes pre-loaded with sample translations including:
